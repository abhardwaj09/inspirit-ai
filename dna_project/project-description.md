# Just a quick summary of the project!
- Learned how genomes are stored as data.
- Visualized the genomes using two tools: Multiple Sequence Alignment Viewer and UCSC Genome Browser.
- Understood how to read and parse genomes using Biopython
- Learned how to clean up and preprocess genome data
- Converted genomic data into a feature matrix
- Built a logistic regression model predicting the country a SARS-CoV-2 lineage came from based on its genome
- Implemented Lasso (L1) feature reduction on the model and evaluated it
- Learned the basics of Principal Components Analysis (PCA), a form of unsupervised learning, and applied it to the dataset
- Tried other models, including KNNs and SVCs
